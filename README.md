# LEARNOVA AI 🚀

LEARNOVA is an adaptive, multimodal AI tutor designed to make learning personalized, accessible, and engaging. Unlike traditional search engines or generic chatbots, Nova acts as a patient tutor—breaking down complex concepts step-by-step, generating tailored quizzes, and summarizing study materials.

Built natively for English, Bangla, and Banglish, LEARNOVA adapts to your proficiency level and learning style to ensure concepts truly click.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- A Supabase Project
- A Google Gemini API Key

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learnova-ai.git
   cd learnova-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   Copy the example environment file and fill in your keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   You will need:
   - `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (from Supabase dashboard)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Google AI Studio) — comma-separate multiple keys for rotation
   - `GROQ_API_KEY` (Groq console) — optional but recommended; comma-separate multiple keys
   - `AI_PREFER_GROQ=true` (default) routes chat/quiz/voice to Groq first, then Gemini on failure
   - Ensure the VITE_ prefixed keys match the Supabase keys for client-side access.

4. **Database Setup:**
   Run the Supabase SQL commands provided in your Supabase SQL editor to create the `profiles`, `quizzes`, `notes`, and `badges` tables, along with RLS policies.

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## 🌐 Deployment (Vercel)

LEARNOVA uses TanStack Start with the **Nitro Vercel preset** (see `vite.config.ts`). Production builds emit `.vercel/output` for Vercel's Build Output API.

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Import the repository in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new).
3. Set the framework preset to **TanStack Start** (or let Vercel auto-detect).
4. Add environment variables (Project → Settings → Environment Variables):
   - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (same values as above)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY` (server-only; comma-separated for key pools; never `VITE_` prefix)
   - `AI_PREFER_GROQ` (optional, default `true`)
5. Run the SQL in `20260518185007_*.sql` and `supabase_init.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor.
6. Click **Deploy**.

For local production preview after `npm run build`: `npm run start` (Node) or `npx vite preview`.

## 🏆 Hackathon Submission

This project was built for the upcoming hackathon.

**What's inside?**
- A highly polished user interface with modern glassmorphism and aurora backgrounds.
- Deep integration of Gemini 2.5 Flash with custom system prompts that enforce safety and language mirroring.
- A gamified progression system powered by Supabase.

Good luck and happy learning!
